## Demo
Paste the notes from notes.txt into the textarea in order to generate a quiz. Or paste these sample notes about Biology:

Cell Theory:
All living organisms are composed of cells.
The cell is the basic unit of life.
All cells come from pre-existing cells.

Types of Cells:
Prokaryotic Cells: Lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles (e.g., bacteria).
Eukaryotic Cells: Have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles (e.g., plant and animal cells).

Cell Organelles:
Nucleus: Contains genetic material (DNA) and controls cell activities.
Mitochondria: Site of cellular respiration, produces ATP (energy).
Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): Involved in protein synthesis and transport.
Golgi Apparatus: Modifies, packages, and transports proteins.
Ribosomes: Synthesize proteins.
Lysosomes: Contain enzymes for intracellular digestion.
Chloroplasts (in plant cells): Site of photosynthesis.

DNA and Genetics:
DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid): Genetic material carrying instructions for the development and functioning of all living organisms.
Genes: Segments of DNA that code for specific traits.
Chromosomes: Structures composed of DNA and proteins, carrying genetic information.
Mitosis: Cell division for growth and repair.
Meiosis: Cell division for the formation of gametes (sperm and egg cells).

Evolution:
Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution: Natural selection leads to the gradual change in species over time.
Adaptation: Traits that increase an organism's chances of survival and reproduction.

## Next steps / ideas
[ ] Allow user to schedule study sessions to find optimal learning times  
[ ] Friends list to add buddies 
[ ] Add pear learning where multiple students can share their schedules and find a time to study together  
[ ] Send reminders to study and/or motivational messages through email  
[ ] AI creates quizzes that adapt in difficulty based on the studentâ€™s performance  
[ ] Use AI to analyze a student's strengths and weaknesses based on quiz / flashcard performance and create a customized study plan based on that  
[ ] A dashboard to display such info  
[ ] Generate a report based on their learning habits, topics they studied and their performances on each of the topics  
[ ] Allowing user to export such report as a pdf
