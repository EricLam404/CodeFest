## Demo
Paste the notes from notes.txt into the textarea in order to generate a quiz. Or paste these sample notes about Biology:

Cell Theory:
All living organisms are composed of cells.
The cell is the basic unit of life.
All cells come from pre-existing cells.

Types of Cells:
Prokaryotic Cells: Lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles (e.g., bacteria).
Eukaryotic Cells: Have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles (e.g., plant and animal cells).

Cell Organelles:
Nucleus: Contains genetic material (DNA) and controls cell activities.
Mitochondria: Site of cellular respiration, produces ATP (energy).
Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): Involved in protein synthesis and transport.
Golgi Apparatus: Modifies, packages, and transports proteins.
Ribosomes: Synthesize proteins.
Lysosomes: Contain enzymes for intracellular digestion.
Chloroplasts (in plant cells): Site of photosynthesis.

DNA and Genetics:
DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid): Genetic material carrying instructions for the development and functioning of all living organisms.
Genes: Segments of DNA that code for specific traits.
Chromosomes: Structures composed of DNA and proteins, carrying genetic information.
Mitosis: Cell division for growth and repair.
Meiosis: Cell division for the formation of gametes (sperm and egg cells).

Evolution:
Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution: Natural selection leads to the gradual change in species over time.
Adaptation: Traits that increase an organism's chances of survival and reproduction.
